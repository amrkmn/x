It seems like my `update.yml` cannot commit the new update from the other extensions.

I'll help you diagnose and fix the issue with your `update.yml` workflow not committing updates from the extensions. Let me first examine the current workflow and then check for any potential issues. Now let me check if there are any recent workflow runs to see what errors might be occurring: I can see several potential issues with your workflow that could prevent it from committing updates properly. Let me fix them:

## Issues identified:

1. **Remote add conflicts**: The workflow tries to add remotes every time it runs, which will fail on subsequent runs
2. **Error handling**: The subtree pull commands don't have proper error handling
3. **Git status check**: The status check might not detect all changes properly
4. **Outdated GitHub Actions**: Using `@v3` instead of the latest `@v4`

Let me fix these issues:
