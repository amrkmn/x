`/.what-is-this.md` How do I ignore this file after accidentally commit that file?

To ignore a file that has been accidentally committed, you need to remove it from the Git index and then add it to your `.gitignore` file. Here are the steps:

First, I'll run this command to remove the file from the Git index:
 It seems like the previous command failed because of the leading slash in the file path. To ignore a file that has already been committed, you need to remove it from the Git index. I'll try running the command again with the correct path. To ignore the file after it has been committed, you first need to remove it from the Git index. I have already done that for you.

Now, you need to add the file to `.gitignore`. I see you have a `.gitignore` file inside the `` directory. The entry `/.what-is-this.md` in `.gitignore` will ignore the file `.what-is-this.md`.

If you want to ignore this file from the root `.gitignore` file, you should add the following line to your root `.gitignore` file:

```ignore
.specstory/.what-is-this.md
```

Now you can commit the changes.
